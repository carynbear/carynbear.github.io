# Highlights of being a middle school Computer Science teacher!
Important caveat, I learned on the job and had no real training to be a middle school teacher aside from my degree in CS and having taught university level courses at Berkeley. It was a humbling experience and by far the most difficult job I've ever had!

# 2019-2020 - Becoming a teacher, COVID Hits, it's a fun mess
I joined Synapse midway through the 19-20 school year just one month before COVID hit the U.S. Looking back, I should have seen the pandemic coming given the news coming from Asia; but I, like many others, was woefully naive. It's funny to think about how I was planning out the rest of the school year while completely ignoring the rest of the world.

Come March, I was abruptly thrust into the role of helping our school transition to distance learning alongside our leadership team. Thankfully, I had plenty of experience with Zoom while working at TeachFX as an engineer. To kickstart our whirlwind of switching to online learning, I onboarded all our staff onto Zoom and gave Zoom workshops to our teachers. For the rest of the school year, I continued to hold tech office hours to support our teachers with distance learning tools. 

Meanwhile, in my classroom, we fumbled a few times but made it through in the end. There was a week or two of adhoc lessons, one particularly fun lesson (at least for me) was on the topic of the [history of the internet](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kDKlHcvJxuNZ1F1M6zC23e9knNNWslvT53JMZaif5ms/edit?usp=sharing) where we got to use some old terminal-based emulators to access the internet. I really enjoyed the Crash Course Computer Science series.

One lesson I learned was that _advanced_ is a very relative word. I was told my students had 2-3 years of Python and Javascript under their belt, and that they were really advanced and needed a big challenge. My reaction to that was diving into how to parse tokens and create light interpreters (calculators). Little did I know that "middle school advanced" is pretty much basic if-else statements (if even that). Anyway. That was a fun disaster. I learned a lot and I can only hope that the kids did too. 

Tools I used: 
- CodeHS, Tynker
- Snap filters
- PearDeck
- Kahoot
- Schoology

Curriculum / Lessons:
- History of the internet and computers
- Functional programming
- Parsing and calculators
