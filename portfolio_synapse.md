## Some highlights of my time as a middle school Computer Science teacher at Synapse School!

# COVID
I joined Synapse midway through the 19-20 school year just one month before COVID hit the U.S. Looking back, I should have seen the pandemic coming given the news coming from Asia; but I, like many others, was woefully naive.  

Immediately I was thrust into the role of helping our school transition to distance learning alongside our leadership team. Thankfully, I had plenty of experience with Zoom while working at TeachFX as an engineer. To kickstart our whirlwind of switching to online learning, I onboarded all our staff onto Zoom and gave Zoom workshops to our teachers. For the rest of the school year, I continued to hold tech office hours to support our teachers with distance learning tools.
