## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="caryn.png">

Hi! I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Learning Sciences at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. I love to dance and cook!

## Research Interest

I am interested in interfaces, programming languages, and learning environments for K-12 CS education. This includes visual programming languages, online programming editors, ML-assisted programming, and collaborative programming. I'm also exploring the future of programming and Computer Science education as it evolves due to LLMs, multi-modal ML, and the invention of new computing interfaces. My secondary interest is broadly in applications and algorithms in ML.
